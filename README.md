## About the project

This project implements a simple header, footer, and authentication card components by making use of Web Components (with OpenWC generator), and Lion UI.

As for the features of the project:
- Login and Registration;
- Terms agreement for the registration part as I wanted to use and try more of the Lion UI components, and it seemed like a good fit;
- Storage of users - used LocalStorage for this.


## What I learned

It was a valuable experience for me to make this, since I am coming from a React background and it was a good introduction to Web Components, Lit elements and their properties, and also using Lion UI through these components.
